This course was taught in Fall 2025 semester at the University College Dublin. The course was delivered in-person, with materials posted via Brightspace platform. Content was delivered over a 6-7 week period following a corresponding length segment on Microeconomics. However, this Macro course does NOT assume any knowledge of Microeconomics.

While no textbook is strictly required for the course,  Principles of Economics (3e), by D. Shapiro, D. MacDonland, S. Greenlaw (2022 Rice University) is a great 'companion' textbook that complements many of the lectures and topics covered in the course.

Included in this  repository are (i) the syllabus, and (ii) lecture slides from the course. All these materials can be found in corresponding folders within the main repository.

This course was developed by Alexander Yarkin at the School of Economics, University College Dublin.
