This course was taught in Fall 2025 semester at the University College Dublin. The course was delivered in-person, with materials posted via Brightspace platform. Content was delivered over a 6-7 week period following a corresponding length segment on Microeconomics. However, this Macro course does NOT assume any knowledge of Microeconomics.

In contrast to many other Intro courses in Macroeconomics, this course attempts to blend more data, interactive online tools, and historical background into the otherwise standard Macro topics, such as measuring incomes and prices, growth, AD-AS model, fiscal policy, and so on. The course relies heavily on two online databases / sources: (i) Our World in Data https://ourworldindata.org/, and (ii) Irish macroeconomic database at https://data.cso.ie/# 

While no textbook is strictly required for the course, Principles of Economics (3e), by D. Shapiro, D. MacDonland, S. Greenlaw (2022 Rice University) is a great 'companion' textbook that complements many of the lectures and topics covered in the course.

Included in this repository are (i) the syllabus, and (ii) lecture slides from the course. All these materials can be found in corresponding folders within the main repository.

This course was developed by Alexander Yarkin at the School of Economics, University College Dublin.
